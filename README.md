### Approach

Generally, I start each problem defining the domain models which capture all the information provided via the input. Then, once I've completed parsing into that data structure, I'll solve the problem.

I prefer functional/immutable data-oriented approaches over dynamic ones.

### TypeScript solutions

Use commands like the following to run and experiment with the TypeScript solutions. If you don't have `deno`, you can follow the [installation instructions](https://deno.land/manual@v1.28.2/getting_started/installation).

```
deno run -A --watch ./part-1.ts
deno run -A --watch ./part-2.ts
```
